DGL CHEM
====================

This is a python package to support Chemical property prediction using `PyTorch <link>`_.
The ambition of this project is to build a flexible pipeline that lets users go from molecule
descriptors (SMILES) to a fully functioning Graph Neural Network and allow for useful flexibility
in every step.

*Add pytorch geometric link.*

For a small overview of what the package is currently capable of, see <Demonstration>.

.. note::

   This project is a work in progress!
