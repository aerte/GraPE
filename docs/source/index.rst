GraPE - Graph-based Property Estimation
==================================

This is a python package to support Chemical property prediction using `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.
html>`_ and `PyTorch Geometric <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
The ambition of this project is to build a flexible pipeline that lets users go from molecule
descriptors (SMILES) to a fully functioning Graph Neural Network and allow for useful customization
in every step.
