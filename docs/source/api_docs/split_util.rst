Splitting utils and Subset structures
=======================================

There a several utils and data-structures available to use. The most
important ones are ``SubSet``, allowing for easy data-splitting by
defining a sub-set of a dataset purely based on indices, and ``split_data``, which can
perform any of the splitting functions implemented in the toolbox.
